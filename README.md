**Machine Learning | Computer Vision | AI Systems | Python Developer**

👨‍💻 About Me

I am an undergraduate engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that combine Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and scalable AI architectures.

My work focuses on designing real-world ML pipelines — from model training and optimization to deployment and system integration.

I enjoy building systems where:

Models don’t just predict — they interact

Agents don’t just respond — they collaborate

Vision systems don’t just detect — they understand context
